                    1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Var:</span> The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside
                        a function. This means
                        that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the
                        whole
                        window.This means you can access the variable before it's declared in the code, but it will have
                        an initial value of undefined. <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Example:</span> <br>
                        function example() {
                        if (true) {
                        var x = 10;
                        }
                        console.log(x);
                        }
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Let:</span> let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no
                        surprise as it comes as an
                        improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. While
                        let variables are hoisted to the top of their containing block, they are not initialized, and
                        trying to access them before declaration results in a ReferenceError. <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Example:</span>: <br>
                        let greeting = "say Hi";
                        if (true) {
                        let greeting = "say Hello instead";
                        console.log(greeting);
                        }
                        console.log(greeting);
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Const:</span> Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped
                        and only accessible within the nearest pair of curly braces {} where they are defined.const
                        cannot be updated or re-declared.This means that the value of a variable declared with const
                        remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Example:</span><br>
                        1.const PI = 3.14159;<br>
                        PI = 3.14; <br>

                        2.const arr = [1, 2, 3];<br>
                        arr.push(4);
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span> When a variable is declared but not initialized, it automatically has the value undefined. For function parameters that are not provided when the function is called, they also have the value undefined. <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Example:</span> <br>
                        let x; 

                        function greet(name) {
                            console.log(`Hello, ${name}`); 
                        }

                        const person = { firstName: 'John' };
                        console.log(person.lastName); 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">Null:</span> Unlike undefined, null is typically used explicitly to indicate that a variable or object property intentionally has no value or represents the absence of an object. It's often used when you want to reset a variable or property to a known empty state. <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Example:</span> <br>
                        let car = null; 

                            function getCarModel(carInfo) {
                                if (carInfo && carInfo.model) {
                                    return carInfo.model;
                                } else {
                                    return null; 
                                }
                            }

                            const myCarInfo = { make: 'Toyota' };
                            const model = getCarModel(myCarInfo);

                            if (model === null) {
                                console.log('Model information is missing or unknown.');

                    3.What do you mean by REST API?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an architectural style and a set of constraints for designing and interacting with web services. REST is not a technology or a protocol but rather a set of principles and constraints that are often used in combination with HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to create web services and APIs. <br>

                        Key principles and characteristics of a RESTful API include:<br><br>

                        1. **Stateless**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests. This simplifies the server and allows it to scale more easily.<br>

                        2. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and storing data.<br>

                        3. **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs have a consistent and uniform interface, which is defined by a set of constraints. This includes using standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and others for specific actions. Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).<br>

                        4. **Resource-Based**: Resources are the core abstraction in REST. Resources are entities that can be identified and manipulated using URIs. They can represent objects, data, or services. For example, in a RESTful API for a blog, resources could include articles, comments, and authors.<br>

                        5. **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients interact with these representations to perform actions on resources. The representation contains both the data and metadata about the resource.<br>

                        6. **Statelessness**: As mentioned earlier, each request is independent, and the server does not store information about the client's state. Any necessary state information must be included in the request.<br>

                        7. **Stateless Communication**: REST APIs use stateless communication, meaning that each request from the client to the server must include all the necessary information for the server to understand and fulfill the request. The server does not retain information about previous requests.<br>

                        8. **Layered System**: REST allows for the use of a layered system architecture, where a client may not be aware of the existence of intermediate layers (proxies, load balancers, caches, etc.) between itself and the server. This enhances scalability and flexibility.<br>

                        9. **Cacheability**: Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. This allows for efficient use of caching mechanisms to improve performance.

                        RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services because they are simple, scalable, and can be easily understood and consumed by both humans and machines. They are commonly used in conjunction with HTTP, making them a popular choice for web-based applications and services. Clients can make HTTP requests to interact with resources on the server, and the server responds with the appropriate representation of the resource's state.
